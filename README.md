# PIOperator:
some physics informed neural operators in classic fluid flows, and all models will use Pytorch framwork

# Data:
1.Burgers 1d and Burgers 2d flow
2.Darcy flow
3.NS equation 2d
tips: more datasets will be added 

# Operator Method(pytorch):
1.DeepONet
2.POD-DeepONet
3.PI-DeepONet
4.FNO
5.PI-FNO
